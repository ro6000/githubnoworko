        /* for this assigment you are going to practice creating objects and calling methods

Although not needed you may want to look at
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Date.html
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html?java/util/Random.html

You will need to do this assignment in Java (some of these classes do not exist in C#) Everything in this project should be
the same syntax in C# and Java aside from the print statements. (Java uses System.out.println() instead of Console.WriteLine())
